Overview
--------

The `launch_mechanical() <../api/ansys/mechanical/core/mechanical/index.html#mechanical.launch_mechanical>`_ method
creates an instance of the `Mechanical <../api/ansys/mechanical/core/mechanical/Mechanical.html>`_
class in the background and sends commands to it as a service. Because errors and warnings
are processed Pythonically, you can develop a script in real time without worrying about
whether the script runs correctly when deployed in batch mode.

Here is how you use the `launch_mechanical()`_ method to launch Mechanical from Python in gRPC mode:

.. code:: python

    import os
    from ansys.mechanical.core import launch_mechanical

    mechanical = launch_mechanical()

If multiple versions of product are installed, then you can use ``exec_file`` argument
to select the version of the product to launch.

.. code:: python

    exec_file_path = "C:/Program Files/ANSYS Inc/v252/aisol/bin/win64/AnsysWBU.exe"
    mechanical = launch_mechanical(
        exec_file=exec_file_path, batch=False, cleanup_on_exit=False
    )

If ``batch`` option is set to ``True`` Mechanical is launched without GUI. The ``cleanup_on_exit``
option decides whether product exits at the end of the PyMechanical script or not.

.. note::
   ``version`` argument is used only if PyPIM is configured. For general cases, use ``exec_file``

You can send genuine Python class commands to the application when Mechanical is active.
For example, you can send a Python script:

.. code:: python

    result = mechanical.run_python_script("2+3")
    result = mechanical.run_python_script("ExtAPI.DataModel.Project.ProjectDirectory")

Mechanical interactively returns the result of each command that you send,
saving the result to the logging module.

Errors are caught immediately. In the following code, an invalid command is sent,
and an error is raised:

.. code:: pycon

    >>> mechanical.run_python_script("2****3")
    grpc.RpcError:
    "unexpected token '**'"

Because the error is caught immediately, you can write your Mechanical scripts in
Python, run them interactively, and then run them in batch without worrying if the
scripts run correctly. This would not be the case if you had instead outputted the
scripts that you wrote to script files.

The `Mechanical`_ class supports
much more than sending text to Mechanical. It includes higher-level wrapping
that provides for better scripting and interaction with Mechanical. For information
on advanced methods for interacting with Mechanical, see :ref:`ref_examples`.
