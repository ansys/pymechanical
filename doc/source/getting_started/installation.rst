Installation guide
==================

To use PyMechanical, a licensed copy of Ansys Mechanical must be installed locally.
The installed version determines the available interface and features.
PyMechanical is compatible with Mechanical **2024 R1** and later on Windows
and Linux. If you face any issues while setting up or using PyMechanical,
please go though :ref:`FAQs <faq>` and :ref:`known issues and limitations <ref_known_issues_and_limitation>` sections.

Install the package
-------------------

The latest ``ansys.mechanical.core`` package supports Python 3.10 through
Python 3.13 on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

You should consider installing PyMechanical in a virtual environment.
For more information, see Python's
`venv -- Creation of virtual environments <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_.

Install the latest package from `PyPi
<https://pypi.org/project/ansys-mechanical-core/>`_ with this command:

.. code::

   pip install ansys-mechanical-core

Install offline
---------------

If you want to install PyMechanical on a computer without access to the internet,
you can download a wheelhouse archive that corresponds to your
machine architecture from the `Releases page <https://github.com/ansys/pymechanical/releases>`_
of the PyMechanical repository.

Each wheelhouse archive contains all the Python wheels necessary to install
PyMechanical from scratch on Windows and Linux for Python 3.10 through Python 3.13. You can install
a wheelhouse archive on an isolated system with a fresh Python installation or on a
virtual environment.

For example, on Linux with Python 3.10, unzip the wheelhouse archive and install it with
this code:

.. code::

   unzip ansys-mechanical-core-v0.12.dev0-wheelhouse-Linux-3.10 wheelhouse
   pip install ansys-mechanical-core -f wheelhouse --no-index --upgrade --ignore-installed

If you are on Windows with Python 3.10, unzip the ``ansys-mechanical-core-v0.12.dev0-wheelhouse-Windows-3.10``
wheelhouse archive to a ``wheelhouse`` directory and then install it using ``pip`` as
in the preceding example.

Verify your installation
------------------------

The way that you verify your installation depends on whether you want to run
Mechanical using a remote session or an embedded instance.
Before running either, you must first verify that you can find
the installed version of Mechanical using the ``ansys.tools.path`` package.
This package is required to use PyMechanical.

.. code:: pycon

   >>> from ansys.tools.path import find_mechanical
   >>> find_mechanical()

   or

   >>> find_mechanical(version=252)  # for specific version

   ('C:/Program Files/ANSYS Inc/v252/aisol/bin/winx64/AnsysWBU.exe', 25.2)  # Windows
   ('/usr/ansys_inc/v252/aisol/.workbench', 25.2) # Linux

If you install Ansys in a directory other than the default or typical location,
you can save this directory path using the
`save_mechanical_path <../api/_autosummary/ansys.tools.path.save_mechanical_path.html#ansys.tools.path.save_mechanical_path>`_
function. Then use
`get_mechanical_path <../api/_autosummary/ansys.tools.path.get_mechanical_path.html#ansys.tools.path.get_mechanical_path>`_
and ``version_from_path`` functions to verify the path and version.

.. code:: pycon

   >>> from ansys.tools.path import save_mechanical_path, find_mechanical
   >>> save_mechanical_path("home/username/ansys_inc/v252/aisol/.workbench")
   >>> path = get_mechanical_path()
   >>> print(path)

   /home/username/ansys_inc/v252/aisol/.workbench

   >>> version = version_from_path("mechanical", path)

   252

Verify a remote session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Verify your installation by starting a remote session of Mechanical from Python:

.. code:: pycon

    >>> from ansys.mechanical.core import launch_mechanical
    >>> mechanical = launch_mechanical()
    >>> mechanical

    Ansys Mechanical [Ansys Mechanical Enterprise]
    Product Version:252
    Software build date: 06/13/2025 15:54:58

If you see a response from the server, you can begin using Mechanical
as a service.

Verify an embedded instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Verify your installation by loading an embedded instance of Mechanical in Python.

.. note::

   If you are running on Linux, you must set some environment variables for
   embedding of Mechanical in Python to work. A script that sets these variables is
   shipped with ``ansys-mechanical-env`` which is part of PyMechanical

   To use the script, prepend it to any invocation of Python:

   .. code:: shell

      $ mechanical-env python

Inside of Python, use the following commands to load an embedded instance:

.. code:: pycon

   >>> from ansys.mechanical.core import App
   >>> app = App()
   >>> print(app)

   Product Version:252
