Getting started
===============

PyMechanical is part of the broader `PyAnsys <pyansys_>`_ initiative,
enabling the use of Ansys technologies directly from Python.
It allows users to integrate the Mechanical multiphysics solver
into custom applications via ``ansys-mechanical-core``, which provides a Python-friendly
interface to drive the software that facilitates the use of
:ref:`ref_user_guide_scripting` commands.

Background
----------

PyMechanical contains two interfaces: a remote session and an embedded instance.
For information on the application architecture of Mechanical and why there are
two Python interfaces, see :ref:`ref_architecture`.
