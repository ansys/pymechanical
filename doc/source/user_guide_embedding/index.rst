Overview
========
The :class:`Application <ansys.mechanical.core.embedding.Application>` class holds an
instance of the Mechanical Application.

.. code:: python

    from ansys.mechanical.core import Application
    app = Application()
    ns = app.DataModel.Project.Model.AddNamedSelection()

The `Application` class has access to the global scripting entry points that are available
from built-in Mechanical scripting. These are:

* ExtAPI - ``Application.ExtAPI``
* DataModel - ``Application.DataModel``
* Model - ``Application.DataModel.Project.Model``
* Tree - ``Application.DataModel.Tree``
* Graphics - ``Application.ExtAPI.Graphics``

Besides the scripting entry points, many other types and objects are available from
built-in Mechanical scripting. To learn about how to import the scripting entry points,
namespaces, and types, see :ref:`ref_embedding_user_guide_globals`.

Additional configuration
------------------------
By default, the Ansys Mechanical Application object is configured in the same way as the
Ansys Mechanical application. To customize this, see :ref:`ref_embedding_user_guide_configuration`.
