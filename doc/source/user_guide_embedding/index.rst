Overview
========
The :class:`Application <ansys.mechanical.core.embedding.Application>` class provides
a Mechanical instance.

.. code:: python

    from ansys.mechanical.core import Application
    app = Application()
    ns = app.DataModel.Project.Model.AddNamedSelection()

The `Application` class has access to the global scripting entry points that are available
from built-in Mechanical scripting. These are:

* ExtAPI: ``Application.ExtAPI``
* DataModel: ``Application.DataModel``
* Model: ``Application.DataModel.Project.Model``
* Tree: ``Application.DataModel.Tree``
* Graphics: ``Application.ExtAPI.Graphics``

Besides the scripting entry points, many other types and objects are available from
built-in Mechanical scripting. To learn how to import the scripting entry points,
namespaces, and types, see :ref:`ref_embedding_user_guide_globals`.

Additional configuration
------------------------
By default, an instance of the :class:`Application <ansys.mechanical.core.embedding.Application>` class
is configured in the same way as Mechanical. To customize this, see
:ref:`ref_embedding_user_guide_configuration`.
