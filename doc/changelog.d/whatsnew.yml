- title: gRPC Security with mTLS, WNUA, and Insecure Transport Modes
  version: 0.12.0
  content: |
    PyMechanical now supports comprehensive gRPC security with three transport modes: ``mtls`` (mutual TLS,
    Linux default), ``wnua`` (Windows Named User Authentication, Windows default), and ``insecure`` mode.
    Platform-aware defaults are automatically selected based on the operating system.

    The implementation includes automatic service pack detection and validation, custom gRPC channel options
    support, and new CLI flags (``--transport-mode``, ``--certs-dir``, ``--grpc-host``).
    All launch and connection APIs (``launch_mechanical()``, ``connect_to_mechanical()``, etc.) now support
    ``transport_mode``, ``certs_dir``, ``grpc_options``, and ``host`` parameters for configuring gRPC security.


    Usage:
    .. code:: python

       from ansys.mechanical.core import launch_mechanical

       # Platform defaults (mTLS on Linux, WNUA on Windows)
       mechanical = launch_mechanical()

       # For older versions without required service packs
       mechanical = launch_mechanical(transport_mode="insecure")
