    See https://github.com/ansys/pymechanical/issues/1136

    Windows store Python uses the Win32 API SetDefaultDllDirectories

    dependency.

    PyMechanical loads the embedding library which automatically sets
    these Paths, but this uses the PATH environment variable which doesn't
    work for Windows store Python.

    We provide a workaround for versions 2024R2 and 2025R1 that sets
    these paths using `os.add_dll_directory`.

    Note:   This workaround does not include DLL paths used in FSI
            mapping workflows.
