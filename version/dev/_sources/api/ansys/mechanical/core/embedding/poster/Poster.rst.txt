    from ansys.mechanical.core.embedding.poster import Poster





Method detail
-------------
.. py:method:: try_post(callable: Callable) -> Any

   
   Post the callable to Mechanical's main thread.

   This does the same thing as `post` but if `callable`
   raises an exception, try_post will raise the same
   exception to the caller of `try_post`.

.. py:method:: post(callable: Callable) -> Any

   
   Post the callable to Mechanical's main thread.

   The main thread needs to be receiving posted messages
   in order for this to work from a background thread. Use
   the `sleep` routine from the `utils` module to make
   Mechanical available to receive messages.

   Returns the result of `callable` if any.
